According to Hanoi Tower. We are taking three pillars for the disk. 
One is source which will contain all the disk.
One is destination in which we need to put the disk as it was in in initial stage in source.
One is auxillary or imtermediate or middle pillar which will be act as an extra pillar which is useful for maintaining the order in destination.
 

Conditions:

We can only move one disk at a time.
We cannot place larger disk on smaller disk.

Logic:


If number of disk is zero the just return no need to do anything.
If number of disk is one then just move the disk from source to destination.
